# python

All files in this folder are very rough attempts at coding functional multi-faceted programs in Python.
Archimedes.py, in particular, is a Discord bot that is built to read messages and perform games based on the consecutive messages sent by the initial sender.
The formatting, accuracy, and optimization of all code written in Archimedes is imperfect as I was using it more as an attempt to learn the language, rather than
be something published for community or commercial use.
